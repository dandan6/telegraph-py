# telegraph-py
Use telegra.ph from Python

This code is licensed under the MIT license, refer to [the telegraph.py file](telegraph.py).

Currently it outputs this when run:

    âžœ  telegraph-py git:(master) python3 telegraph.py                                            
    I chose a random tph_uuid for you. Save it if you want to edit this post later.
    tph_uuid=ptQzBEEiLVczIK7WaoJSzqCH2Xm2CRNO78uOJifY8K
    {"page_id":"18a54c6149f9ed68fde24","path":"Lets-make-a-post-11-23-10"}

`telegraph-py` is a really new project and all help is appreciated.
